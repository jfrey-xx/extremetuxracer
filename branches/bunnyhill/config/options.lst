# forward_clip_distance
# Controls how far ahead of the camera the course
# is rendered.  Larger values mean that more of the course is
# rendered, resulting in slower performance. Decreasing this 
# value is an effective way to improve framerates.
# 
[forwardclip] 125


# backward_clip_distance
# [EXPERT] Some objects aren't yet clipped to the view frustum, 
# so this value is used to control how far up the course these 
# objects are drawn.

[backwardclip] 20


# near_clip_distance
# [EXPERT] This value is used for setting the viewport
# 
[nearclip] 0.1

# [EXPERT] Sets the camera field of view

# bpp_mode
# Controls how many bits per pixel are used in the game.

# If your computer is fast enough (> 40 fps) you needn't show the fps.

# show_herring
# If false the herrings are unvisible. This option seems to be
# nonsense but it can be helpful for time measuring regardless
# of the herrings.

# draw_particles
# Controls the drawing of snow particles that are kicked up as Tux

# If true then the track of the previous race is shown.

# If true then the trackmarks are not calculated in each frame.
# That improves performance but the track might appear less beautifully.

# On a normal course you never see the top, back and bottom view
